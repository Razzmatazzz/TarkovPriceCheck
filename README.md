# Tarkov Price Check

Tarkov Price Check is a tool that allows you to search the tarkov-tools.com API for item prices using voice commands. While running the program, just speak "price check [item name]" into your microphone, and it will display the results.

Full disclosure: it doesn't work great. It uses the native Windows voice recognition libraries. Microphone quality probably also plays a role. But I wanted to try my hand at a voice recognition app while also showcasing the tarkov-tools.com API.
